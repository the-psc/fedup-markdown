# Writing for Markdown

# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor such as Atom or Sublime.

It enables source code written with easily readable notation to be rendered in HTML. Like using 'styles' and formatting options in Excel, Word etc.

It's easy to use and you may have come across it in various places in the web or used it in Slack.

# Why do we use it?

* It's quick and easy to get the hang of
* You can incorporate other styles into it through templates and CSS
* GitHub allows you host websites for free using static website generators - and Markdown is great for that
* GOV.UK has made extensive use of Markup and the service Tech Docs is mostly written in Markdown
